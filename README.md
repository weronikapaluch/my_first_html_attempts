# my_first_html_attempts
About a year ago I watched a **Thomas Frank** video on YouTube about procrastination, or some other productivity related topic, in which he mentioned Jen Dewalt and her **180 day project**. Over the course of those 180 days, she coded one, relatively simple website (all of which is obv documented on her github ðŸ˜Ž). Including her in the video amied to show the viewer to **_JUST DO IT_**! It can be simple, and imperfect in the begining but we all have to start somewhere, before we become better.


Inspired by this story, I decided to give *html* a go, and have some with it. ðŸ¤©
